## 1. Preface 

​	In the real society, wealth is no longer fully measured by the quantity of money, while instead it depends more on the non-monetary assets one has which include but are not limited to houses, cars, stocks, artworks and other items with a certain market value.

​	In the blockchain world, cryptocurrency is used to characterize monetary assets, and another value medium that manifests non-monetary assets is NFT, which will become an important part of the wealth in the decentralization network.

​	However, as NFT is booming, it’s also faced with many problems. Liquidity of high-value NFTs is poor and it’s difficult for ordinary people to be involved. Due to the anonymity of decentralization, NFT copyrights confirmation will see some hardship.

## 2. About JIAOE

​	JIAOE is committed to becoming the most professional, credible and efficient NFT decentralized trading platform across the globe to provide users with a full-link solution for asset transactions, asset trust, and asset circulation.

​	JIAOE is divided into three major sections. The first is trading market, which is mainly used for NFT creation, division and INO. The second is a decentralized exchange, mainly providing secondary transactions. The third is ecological governance, mainly targeting asset on sale and copyright confirmation. 

​	With the coordinated three sections, JIAOE can finally realize ecological closed loop within the platform. After a certain time of growth, the platform will be eventually transferred into one with a high autonomy by all participants.

## 3. Trading Market

​	One of the core problems in the NFT market is inefficient liquidity. The reason for poor liquidity lies in the lack of an effective value discovery mechanism and an efficient trading market. Poor liquidity makes it difficult for ordinary people to participate in transactions in the NFT market.

### 3.1 Fragmentation 
​	JIAOE allows anyone or organizations to create or introduce NFT and the platform will automatically generate a token contract. The creator controls NFT fragmentation granularity through the total quantity and the initial unit price of the token and finally realizes the fragmentation of their ownership.

​	Token fragmentation reduces barriers to entry and any investors can gain benefits by selling and buying part of the ownership.

### 3.2 Value Discovery
​	JIAOE fragmentation lowers market access threshold and in the meantime various value discovery mechanisms are offered in the platform to assist the NFT owners to set a reasonable and acceptable market price. To achieve this goal, NFT owners can choose their own pre-sale requirements and strategies when creating. The pre-sale requirements mainly include whether KYC certification, whitelisting etc. are needed or not and the pre-sale strategies mainly cover fixed price crowsale, English auction, Dutch auctions, and hybrid auctions (LBP).

​	In addition, JIAOE will develop more platform-specific strategies involving value discovery, and there will even be financial derivatives based on NFT fragments in the future.

### 3.3 Ownership Exclusive
​	DAO is adopted by JIAOE to realize NFT governance. The governance form takes that different NFT value corresponds to different voting rights. Once NFT achieves value division, its corresponding project governance authority will also be divided accordingly.

​	Users with a certain percentage of NFT fragments can offer to purchase the remaining token to buy out the complete NFT assets. The offeror initiates an acquisition price higher than the market price and stakes the assets for acquisition. But the offer is not allowed to be withdrew within the designated acquisition period ruled by the platform.

​	The offeree votes within the acquisition period and when the percentage of concurring votes is greater than a certain value, the acquisition will be accomplished. The staked assets will be transferred to the acquiree and then the NFT fragment token will be destroyed. Finally, the ownership is transferred to the offeror .

## 4. Decentralized Exchange
​	JIAOE will always start with decreasing circulation costs of market makers and secondary market and increasing fund utilization rate to further lower the market access threshold.

### 4.1 Market-Making with a Single Currency
​	The single-currency market-making model in JIAOE imitates how human market makers  place orders and distribute funds around the expected market price to achieve higher liquidity and capital utilization.

## 5. Ecological Governance
​	Any NFT value is supported by values from real-life, and then the anonymity in the blockchain overturns this connection, resulting in a complicated yet mixed NFT market.

​	These scenarios in JIAOE are simplified with a guarantee model. After all, guarantee is a game between risks and returns. The guarantor takes advantage of information gap to gain risk-free profits and the guaranteed NFT can realize decentralized mapping and obtain credibility assurance.

​	Goat Token is a token that realizes the entire ecological governance and used to allocate various resources in the network. Anyone can achieve benefits from the network and for sure the benefit is proportional to the amount of work completed and the quantity of token staked.

### 5.1 Participation Role 
- Creator
  - The creator is NFT producer in JIAOE ecosystem and they can obtain direct benefits by inventing NFTs

- Certifier
  - The certifiers are the professionals or institutions in the NFT ecosystem, guaranteeing NFT
  - Serving this role by mortgaging a certain quantity of platform token
  - The more the platform token staked, the more reliable the certifier and higher credibility of NFT is 
  - The certifier can achieve network rewards through NFT guarantee
  - In case of a false guarantee by the certifier, the staked Token will be possibly confiscated
  - In the early period, the platform will invite capable organizations to be the certifier through signing and in the later period, the certifier will be determined independently by the market 

- Delegator
  - The delegator can delegate the platform token to a trusted certifier for a joint guarantee and share network revenue

- Supervisor
  - The supervisor can obtain benefits by providing valid evidence to accuse the certifier
  - After accusation by the supervisor, DAO court process will be initiated and all the owners shall be in charge

- Consumers
  - Any consumers of the Token

###  5.2 Functions of Token

- Stake
  - Stake Token to be a certifier

- Delegation  
  - Delegation to the certifier will increase the liability of the certifier

- Consumption
  - The consumption of deflation mechanism on the platform

- Community governance
  - Only members with Token can vote and run for election 

### 5.3 Inflation/Disposal 
​	Goat Token will be inflated at a rate of 1% every year and the later inflation rate will be managed through community voting. Part of the network transaction fee will go to the rebate pool and the rest will be disposed. Service charge from the certifier and the delegator, penalty fees, and unclaimed reward fees will also be disposed.

### 5.4 Rewards and Punishment System
​	The Token staked by the certifier in the network have an unlock time. If the certifier do evil during this period and provide consumers with wrong instructions, their Token may be confiscated and disposed.

​	There is no risk for the delegators’ Token, but to reduce the delegators’ motivation that is not conducive to network development, the delegator has to pay a certain price.

​	To encourage stakes, the Token will be inflated at a certain rate every year and inflationary Token will be mainly used to reward certifiers and delegators. The reward is proportional to the amount of work completed and the quantity of staked token. Meanwhile, the supervisor can also obtain rewards from the platform by providing valid evidence to accuse the certifier.

​	Besides inflation rewards, JIAOE also has a rebate pool which will reward based on the contribution value of all network participants. The rebate pool is mainly derived from network transaction fees.

## 6. Multichain

​	In the decentralized world, one chain should not rule everything. The decentralized world should be diversified and public blockchains such as Polkadot, Heco, BSC, and Conflux are emerging. JIAOE will actively explore and figure out distincts of each public blockchain and take well advantages of different public blockchains to promote the prosperity of NFT market as well as the ecoeyestem. 

### 6.1 Ethereum

​	The Ethereum ecosystem is the most developed and most decentralized ecosystem till now. JIAOE will choose to debut the project on the Ethereum network.

​	At present, Ethereum is often faced with network congestion and high Gas fees, thus the platform will eventually choose to be connected to the Layer 2 side chain for resolution. Nevertheless, this is a short-term choice that has to be made.

​	In terms of safety and decentralization degree, Layer2 side chain is uncomparable to that of Ethereum. Once Ethereum EI0-1559 proposal or Ethereum 2.0 can fundamentally solve this problem, side chain solution will be abandoned. 

### 6.2 Polkadot
​	Polkadot is currently the fastest growing and most promising ecology. JIAOE will build a completely decentralized NFT vertical public blockchain on Polkadot's parallel chain according to the product design. Meanwhile, JIAOE public blockchain will be connected to Ethereum network to realize free flow of assets across the chain.

## 7. Platform Token
Total quantity of platform token is 1, 000, 000, 000 and primary circulation is 20%.
